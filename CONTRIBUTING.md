# Contributing

Contributions are welcome through pull requests, however, the reference architecture
is intended to reflect the opinion of Red Hat and IBM based on the key tenants
outlined in the README.md. Therefore only PR's which are aligned with that
opinion will be accepted.

# Checking formatting and style

Before pushing changes contributors need to ensure that their markdown spec is valid
by executing

```
npm install
npm run lint
```
