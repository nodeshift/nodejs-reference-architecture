# Template Engines (Server Side)

## Recommended packages

No recommended packages.

## Guidance

Server side templating is no longer common for creating UIs, and has never been
common for implementing microservice APIs.

React and Angular have alternatives to templating  (Server Side Rendering, SSR).

If a template engine is included in a toolset, then it doesn't have to be
chosen, the recommendation would be to use the one provided (for example,
[eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) uses
[Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) and
[Express](https://expressjs.com/) supports a number of options
including [ejs](https://ejs.co/)).
